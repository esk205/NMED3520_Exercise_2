            <h2>01 | A somewhat recent CSS feature...the bouncing box animation!</h2>
            <p>My favorite CSS animation is the bouncing box animation as that can be handy for drawing attention the user for a notification for example. So in the context of social media this can be quite handy. Also if there is an web page based web browser this notification tool may come in handy.</p>

            <h2>02 | My favorite CSS feature...animation!</h2>
            <p>Enlarging of images when hovering over an object is my favorite CSS feature because I always found it more fun when browsing for items based on pictures and then getting an enlarged view on that image. Look at the grid box below and you can see that I implemented that feature.</p>

            <h2>03 | How AI is impacting Web Design/Development</h2>
            <p>AI is impacting Web Design as the development process is even more frantic than ever before, so there’s going to be a huge expectation for developers to learn how to use AI effectively so they can keep up the rest of software developers to create content efficiently. However, this is a never ending cycle of constantly demanding more productivity with less time so there’s just going to be more pressure on software developers to learn more on top of already the overwhelming amount of technical knowledge they need to know.</p>
